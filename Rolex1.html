     <sub style="color: rgb(7, 104, 7);"> <i> <b> Rolex Submariner is a legendary and iconic dive watch that has transcended 
        its original purpose as a professional tool to become a global symbol of luxury, 
        precision, and durability. Since its introduction in 1953, it has set the standard 
        for what a dive watch should be, and its design has been widely emulated.The dial
         features large, simple-shaped hour markers (triangles, circles, rectangles) and broad 
         "Mercedes-style" hands. These elements are coated with Rolex's proprietary Chromalight
          material, which provides a long-lasting blue luminescence for exceptional legibility in
         low-light conditions.</b> </i> </sub>
