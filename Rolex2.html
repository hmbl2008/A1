     <sub style="color:rgb(185, 103, 3);"> <i> <b> The Daytona's story is inextricably linked
         to the world of motorsports. Rolex became the official timekeeper of the Daytona 
         International Speedway in 1962, a partnership that cemented the brand's connection 
         to racing. The following year, Rolex launched the first "Cosmograph," reference 6239, 
         which would later be nicknamed "Daytona" and have the name officially added to the
          dial.</b> </i> </sub>
