  <p style="color: rgb(7, 60, 159);"> <i><b>The Rolex Datejust is a classic and highly
     versatile timepiece, widely regarded as the quintessential Rolex. It embodies the 
     brand's core values of timeless design, technical innovation, and unwavering reliability
     Launched in 1945 to celebrate Rolex's 40th anniversary, the Datejust was the first self-winding 
     chronometer wristwatch to feature an automatically changing date window on the dial..</b></i></p>

     <sub style="color:rgb(7, 60, 159);"> <i> <b> The Daytona's story is inextricably linked
         to the world of motorsports. Rolex became the official timekeeper of the Daytona 
         International Speedway in 1962, a partnership that cemented the brand's connection 
         to racing. The following year, Rolex launched the first "Cosmograph," reference 6239, 
         which would later be nicknamed "Daytona" and have the name officially added to the
          dial.</b> </i> </sub>
